Hey,

This mini game was developed in 2020 as an assignment for a university course for JavaScript.
Live Server extension through visual studio code is needed for the game to work.

The game mechanics are clunky and need work.

Keybinds:
Accelerate forward - Up arrowkey
Decelerate - Down arrowkey
Adjusting direction - Right/Left arrowkey
Shooting - Space bar
