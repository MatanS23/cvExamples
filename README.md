Hey,

This game was developeds using Unity engine version 2019.4.2f1 back in 2020.

I used this project to just learn game design, level design, basic coding for game mechanics, making ui, making effects, etc.

I recently got back to this project and I plan to at least have a working mini-demo with 10 play-able levels.
