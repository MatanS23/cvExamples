Hey,

This game was developed using Unity game engine, at version 2019.4.2f1 back in 2020.

I used this project to learn game design, level design, programming for game mechanics, making ui, making visual effects, etc.

I recently got back to this project and I plan to at least have 10 completely playable levels with few additional features.
